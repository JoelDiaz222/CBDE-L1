### Explanation of the repository's structure

- The [data_used](data_used) directory contains a Python script to extract.
- The [postgresql](postgresql), [chroma](chroma) and [pgvector](pgvector) 
directories contain the P, C and G scripts, respectively.
  - They also have a directory containing alternative versions used to compare 
  performance between scripts, and a folder that has TXT files with time 
  measurements extracted from the executions of the scripts with the 
  corresponding name. These time measures are used in the written document.
- Each of the main four directories contains a README.md explaining what its 
contents are in more detail.
